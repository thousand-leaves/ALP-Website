# ALP-Website

This is the first version of a business website I made for Alice Landen Prints.

==================================================================================

**Why have I made this?**

My partner and I were running an online etsy shop selling botanical illustration prints and cards, so I decided to make her a website alicelanden.art to showcase her portfolio, contact info, shop etc. I used this project to learn the basics of HTML and CSS while on furlough and travelling in our van across europe.

==================================================================================

**How I expected the challenge to go?**

I expected to encounter a few issues as this was my first website project. To prepare I took an HTML and CSS class on Codecademy and then used this knowledge to create the first basic version of the website. 
I researched bootstrap templates which helped with the portfolio page but I wasn't able to get a carousel working in the way I wanted.

==================================================================================

**What went well? What didn't go as planned?**

I kept the design of the pages very minimal as this is what Alice wanted. The menu bar and footer and content was quite straight forward once I had figured out how to use the grid. 
I wanted to use a carousel but this proved trickier than I thought so I wasnt able to get this working in time for this version. 
The contact page was also tricky as I didn't manage to get the message to send to email. Both these issues are something I plan to fix in the next version.

==================================================================================

**Possible improvements for future revisions of the project:**

For the next version I plan to have a working carousel or improved portfolio page as well as a working contact form.
I would also like to explore using a bootstrap theme with some javascript to make the page more responsive
I also want to focus on making the page mobile first so that the page responds to the device and screensize you are using
